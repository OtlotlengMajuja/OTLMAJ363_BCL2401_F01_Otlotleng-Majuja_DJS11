## Introduction

The Sound Silo Podcast App is a React-based web application that allows users to view pdcast shows, including its seasons and episodes. the app fetches data from a remote API and displays it in a user-friendly interface.

This project showcases my lack of skills in building a scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly application using React.

## Features

- Displays podcast show details, including title and seasons
- Allows users to view seasons and select a season to view its episodes
- Displays episodes for a selected season
- Includes a loading state indicator to show when data is being fetched
- Modal window for selecting a season

## Reflections

### Challenges Faced

The biggest challenge was understanding the requirements of the task and how to implement them. I struggled with the user stories and the overall functionality of the project

### Overall Learning Experience

Working on debugging, refactoring, and enhancing the JavaScript functions has reframed my thoughts on what I had attained in terms of my knowledge base and skill level. I was clearly not as adept at solving the bugs and error handling as I had assumed.
